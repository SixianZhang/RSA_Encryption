# RSA_Encryption

**Hey guys! Feel free to change or upload your part of the code here. If there is any change you want others to know, just leave the comment here (or using email and message as always).**

## Nov 8th
I have modified my RSA code and convert it into python files. You can call the method like this:
```
python RSA_Code.py
```
Currently it just generate random prime number and plain text of 48 bits. I will change it later to accept key length and customized message as input.

You can also import it as a module to use those methods in it.
